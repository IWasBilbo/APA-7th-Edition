# APA 7th Edition for Microsoft Word

Until (unless) Microsoft gets around to adding a template for the latest version, this is the APA 7th Edition XSLT modified by Mike Slagle, plus the two additional fixes posted in the comments found [here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/apa-7th-edition-in-ms-word/486fc70e-b7c7-40df-89bb-f8fc07169d40). This way, if other changes are needed, this file can be updated.

## How to Use

### Windows

1. Exit Word
1. Using Windows Explorer, copy the file APASeventhEdition.xsl to C:\Users\<your_user_name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style 
1. Restart Word and from the References tab in Word, you should be able to choose APA7. 

### MacOS

1. Exit Word
1. Using Finder, copy the fileAPASeventhEdition.xsl to *two* locations:
